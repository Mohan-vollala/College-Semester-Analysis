# College-Semester-Analysis
Data analysis of College students semester results using SQL and Power BI — includes dataset cleaning, visualization, and academic insights.

## 📘 Overview
The dataset originally came in **PDF format** (semester results), which was manually converted to **Excel** for data cleaning and structuring.  
After transforming the data into a **tabular format**, it was imported into an **SQL database** for querying and analysis.  
Finally, **Power BI** was used to build interactive dashboards and reports to visualize student and departmental performance.
It provides insights into subject-wise marks, pass percentages, top-performing students, and overall each section performance.  
The goal is to visualize key academic trends and help institutions make data-driven decisions.
